# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Project
This project involves predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The dataset used is the Wine Quality Dataset, and the project explores multiple machine learning models to classify wine quality.  
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized data using MinMaxScaler, and created binary labels for "good wine."
Data Visualization: Visualized the distribution of wine quality, feature correlations, and prediction errors.
Modeling: Applied RandomForest, KNN, SVM, and Linear Regression to predict wine quality.
Error Analysis: Analyzed model prediction errors to refine and improve accuracy.
Next Steps: Plans include hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and further feature engineering.
